I am Tilak Dave, 18 years old, a student of Computer Science. I am passionately learning and working as a web developer for the last 2 years.

## Problem Identification - Plank Studio

[Plank Studio](https://www.plank.studio/) the current website lacks performance on slow networks. Being a Wix site, customizations, scalability, and feature additions are directly related to increment in the cost.

The current design is a Wix template which uses old design trends and fails to match with the creative work by Plank Studio.

## Solutions offered by me

- Lightning fast, SEO optimized website built with the best technologies.
- Providing 100x bandwidth (lifetime for no extra cost)
- Modern, Minimal Design and a matching logo.
- Content Management System (CMS) for easy customizations on the go.
- Website Analytics using [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com).
