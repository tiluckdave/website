Recently I was on a call with a founder of a Web Developement Agency & He was telling me the his company uses Ruby on Rails as backend and React as frontend for most of their client applications. One thing which even I observe and he did too was on a Job Board you get 1000's of React applications but u hardly get 10 - 50 for Ruby/Ruby on Rails. He then suggested even I should try Rails, its quite good.

So here I am after 2 days of learning and 2 weeks of procrastinating to write this blog!!

![Ruby on Rails](https://www.meme-arsenal.com/memes/be394278fe8c8e6d0ccf0de998eeacf2.jpg)

Ruby has a beautiful syntax and is a very powerful language. Rails built on top of Ruby is a MVC (Model, View, Controller) web framework. [More... here]

## Learning Ruby

Install Ruby by following there guide depending upon your operating system and architecture. Next Search `Ruby Koans` on the internet. You will probably get a GitHub repository or a ZIP file to download. Clone/Extract it and you will have a Readme guide to follow along. Run the koans and start completing tasks one by one. 60-70% should be good enough.

Now lets move on to Rails.
Use `gem` the package manager to install rails and then go to (Ruby on Rails Guides)[guides.rubyonrails.com] and follow along. This website helpos you understand the basics of the MVC architecture used by Rails by making a complete Blog application with comments. It gives you pretty much idea of how ruby and rails work as well as the directory structure and some good practices. This will prepare you to make your next small idea with rails quickly.
