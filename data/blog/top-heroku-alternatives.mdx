## About Heroku

Heroku is a cloud programming platform designed to help build and deploy online applications. Founded in 2007, it is now one of the largest PaaS platforms in existence, with hundreds of thousands of customers spread around the world. It supports six programming languages (through which to develop apps for distribution on the Web) and is based on the Debian operating system or, more recently, Ubuntu (two Linux distributions).

Heroku runs your app in lightweight, isolated Linux containers called "dynos." The platform offers a free tier with 550-1000 dyno hours a month, aling with that free & hobby tiers provide free postgres and redis databases.

### Only downside of Heroku

The only real downsides are not enabling a custom domain and slower cold starts in the free tier.

_A cold start is when the dyno, if it is not used for 30 mins, is spun down until a HTTP request fire's it back up again._

## What has changed

Heroku has decided to terminate all inactive account from October 26, 2022. Well this isn{`'`}t a big deal. The main change is that from **November 28, 2022 this FREE tier will no longer be available**. As part of this, the **free Heroku Postgres**, and free **Heroku Data for Redis® will also be NO LONGER FREE.**

So, if you are currently using a free tier of these, then you will need to upgrade to a paid plan before that date.

Well, Heroku blamed “abuse” on the demise of the free services, which span the free plans for Heroku Dynos and Heroku Postgres as well as the free plan for Heroku Data for Redis.

> “Our product, engineering, and security teams are spending an extraordinary amount of effort to manage fraud and abuse of the Heroku free product plans, We will continue to provide low-cost solutions for compute and data resources.”

**\- Bob Wise, Heroku general manager and Salesforce EVP**
